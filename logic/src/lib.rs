//! Mero Meet — decentralized video-call signaling on Calimero.
//!
//! ## What this contract is (and is NOT)
//!
//! This WASM contract is the **control plane** of a video call. It is the
//! signaling server + room directory + presence layer, replicated as CRDT
//! state across every node in the context. It carries:
//!   - **presence / lobby** — who is in the room, their display name, status,
//!     and whether their mic/camera are on ("find people");
//!   - **WebRTC signaling** — opaque SDP offer/answer + ICE-candidate blobs,
//!     addressed peer→peer (`post_signal` / `get_signals`);
//!   - **call sessions** — a lightweight record of who is currently in a call.
//!
//! It does **NOT** carry the live audio/video media. Per RESEARCH-01.md, media
//! is far too latency-sensitive for a gossip/CRDT layer (libp2p gossip ~1s vs.
//! the <150ms interactive budget). The actual pixels travel peer-to-peer over
//! native WebRTC inside the Tauri desktop backend and never touch this contract.
//!
//! In short: **this contract decides who is allowed in the room and relays the
//! handshake; the media goes around it.**
