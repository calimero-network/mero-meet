// ── CallEngine — the media plane ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A full-mesh WebRTC manager: one RTCPeerConnection per remote peer. It owns
// the camera/mic stream and the peer connections; it does NOT know about
// Calimero. Signaling is delegated to callbacks (`onSignal` out, `handleSignal`
// in) which the call hook wires to the mero-meet contract's post_signal /
// get_signals. This is the seam from RESEARCH-01.md: the contract is the
// (decentralized) signaling channel; the media flows here, peer-to-peer.
//
// Implements MDN's "perfect negotiation" pattern so simultaneous offers (glare)
// resolve deterministically:
//   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Perfect_negotiation
//
// In the Tauri desktop webview this uses the system WebRTC stack (real ICE/UDP).
// A bundled TURN relay (shipped by tauri-app) can be injected via setIceServers.
